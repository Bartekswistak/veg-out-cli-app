# veg-out-cli-app
Command Line Interface application to find nearby vegan and vegetarian restaurants.

This is my first application I will be building from scratch.

How it should work:

Welcome the user to Veg Out
Takes user input "zip code" and return a list of nearby restaurants that offer vegan/vegetarian options.
Asks user if they will like more info on a listed restaurant and will list details such as description, address, phone number, etc..
Source website I will be scraping from is HappyCow.com

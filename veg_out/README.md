# VegOut

Command Line Interface application to find nearby vegan and vegetarian restaurants.

This is my first application I will be building from scratch.

How it should work:

Welcome the user to Veg Out
Takes user input "zip code" and return a list of nearby restaurants that offer vegan/vegetarian options.
Asks user if they will like more info on a listed restaurant and will list details such as description, address, phone number, etc..
Source website I will be scraping from is HappyCow.com


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'veg_out'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install veg_out

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
